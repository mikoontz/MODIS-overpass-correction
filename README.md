# MODIS-overpass-correction

The Aqua and Terra satellites pass over latitudes at different rates (~4 combined overpasses per day near equator, and ~30 combined overpasses per day near poles). 

For MODIS products that yield per-pass data (such as the active fire detection product, MCD14ML), it is important to account for an increased opportunity for detection at higher latitudes by counting the number of times the MODIS sensors viewed each point on Earth.
